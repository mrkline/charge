# Charge

## What is it?

A joke of a project so I can mess around with [D](http://dlang.org).

## What does it do?

It reads laptop battery status using `acpi` and formats it the way I want.
I use it with [conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/).

## Couldn't you have done this with sed, or perl, or something far simpler?

See "What is it?"
